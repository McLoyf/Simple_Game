/* About naming variables
*  This lesson has nothing I don't already know, seeing as this isn't my first programming
*  langauge. The same things apply here, you can't use keywords as a variable name and the
*  name should be specific. variable names can't start with numbers, should not have whitespace
*  and shouldn't be all caps unless it's a true constant. Example of a true constant, double 
*  PI = 3.1415
