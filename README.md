<h1>What is this repository?</h1>

<p>This repository is simply the repository I will put my C++ learning projects, as opposed to having a ton of small repos. The final goal of this repo being the creation of a simple <em>original</em> game, so remaking an old arcade game won't count as being the final goal. I don't know how long this will take so (hopefully) this is a repo that will be actively updated as I learn C++ and skills needed to make a game. This repository is all about learning, the libary I've chosen for this goal is SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) because it's apparently easy to use. It's limited to 2D games which is perfect for a simple, beginner game but I do want to eventually delve into 3D games at some point.</p>

<h2>Why C++?</h2>

<p>I have little to no experience with the langauge, which basically means that I can write a Hello World! program and not much else. I do have a lot of notes about the langauge but without actually experimenting and creating with C++ those notes don't do me any good.</p>

<h2>What will be the final game?</h2>

<p>As of right now I don't know but I do want this simple game to have the following basic features.</p>

<ul>
    <li> Saving game to file/Loading said file
    <li> Multiple Levels/Areas
    <li> 2D animated sprites
    <li> Player Movement (obviously)
    <li> Win/Loss Conditions (it's not fun it you can't lose)
    <li> Enemies and Bosses
    <li> Live System and Healing
    <li> Inventory System
    <li> Main Menu
    <li> Pause Menu
    <li> HUD
    <li> Sound and Music
    <li> Backgrounds/Environments
    <li> Camera Control (Probably scrolling cam that follows player)
    <li> Setting Menu
</ul>

<h2>What will the game run on?</h2>
<p>It'll be a Windows game, at least at the beginning as that's the OS I use but I don't see why I should be limited to Windows. It would be good to ake something to make the game be able to run on Linix, MacOs, Android and IOS.</p>

<p>But that's for later, after I'm done with the game. Right now it's best to not think too much about it, it's a game to run on my laptop for right now.</p>
