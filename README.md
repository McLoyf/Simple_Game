<h2>What is this repository?</h2>
<p>I feel the need to add this section because the name is not very descriptive and it's by design as (at the time of updating the readme) I don't know what <em>exactly</em> this repo is going to turn into but I have an idea of what I what this to be. Despite the repo seemly going to be ONE simple game, I decided that this will be a repo dedicated to projects building up to making a simple-ish ORIGINAL game.</p>

<p>Before moving forward I should define what <em>I</em> mean by original game. I simply mean that it can't just be me remaking a game like Pac-Man but he's green and is being chased by red squares while eating turnips on a maze. Basically I can't just make a clone of a game and change cosmedic things just enough to say it's original but I also don't mean that I have to make a new genre of games never before seen. It's perfectly ok to make a game that is clearly inspired by another, and it's probably what I'll end up doing.</p>

<p>The libary I've chosen for this goal is SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) because it's apparently easy to use. It's limited to 2D games which is perfect for a simple, beginner game but I do want to eventually delve into 3D games at some point.</p>

<h2>Why C++?</h2>
<p>I have little to no experience with the langauge, which basically means that I can write a Hello World! program and not much else. I do have a lot of notes about the langauge but without actually experimenting and creating with C++ those notes don't do me any good. I think making it a github repo will make me more motatived to continue learning this langauge as well as making video games in general.</p>

<h2>Defining a Simple Game</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, I don't know what this game will end up being but there are some basic features I want to the game to have</p>

<ul>
    <li> Saving Compatiabilities
    <li> Multiple Levels/Areas
    <li> 2D Animated Sprites
    <li> Player Movement
    <li> Win/Lose Conditions (it's not fun if you can't lose)
    <li> Enemies and Bosses
    <li> Live System and Healing
    <li> Main Menu
    <li> Pause Menu
    <li> HUD
    <li> Sound and Music
    <li> Backgrounds/Environments
    <li> Camera Control
    <li> Setting Menu
</ul>

<h2>What will the game run on?</h2>
<p>It will be a Windows game because that's the OS I chose to use but whenever I can (and actually remember) I will use things that will work on as devices as possible. Right now I won't worry about it too much, right now this is just a game that will run on my laptop. No need to think about it right now.</p>
